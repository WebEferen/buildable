# Roadmap for Buildable v1

- [] Add custom logger (extract logic outside of modules)
- [] Add dotenv and custom .file read for configuration (and add defaults)
- [] Add readiness validators to support most of well known service listeners such as TSC, Nodemon, HapiJS, Express (or add this as the configuration)
